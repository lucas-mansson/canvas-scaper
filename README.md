# canvas-scaper
An idea for a canvas scraper that will scrape your courses and display all assignments for each course in a combined interface (maybe start with a google sheet), with deadlines etc, as I find the canvas interface shit.

I may also have to add support for other sites, since some courses don't use canvas - maybe this will have to use some LLM magic.

Just an idea atm, will see if and when I have time to implement.
